            Email communication is a cornerstone of online activity. From signing up for services to confirming identities and communicating in business, email plays a central role. However, the evolution of email has introduced two main categories: real (permanent) email accounts and temporary (disposable) emails. In this article, we explore the key differences, benefits, and limitations of each.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is Real Email?</h2>
          <p>
            Real email accounts are provided by services like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, and corporate servers. These accounts require registration, password setup, and often include features such as inbox organization, spam filtering, and secure login methods. They are intended for long-term use.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is Temp Mail?</h2>
          <p>
            Temp mail, or disposable email, allows users to generate a temporary email address without any signup. These addresses expire after a short time or upon browser closure. They’re perfect for one-time use, anonymous activity, and reducing inbox clutter.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Security and Privacy Comparison</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Real Email:</strong> Often encrypted, secured with passwords, 2FA, and identity verification. Ideal for personal and business communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> No authentication required. No password or personal data—high anonymity but low security for sensitive communications.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">When to Use Each</h2>
          <p>
            Temp mail is ideal for situations like:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Signing up for free trials or newsletters</li>
            <li>Accessing downloadable resources without spam risk</li>
            <li>Testing apps and systems during development</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Real email is best for:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Business communication and official documentation</li>
            <li>Banking, medical, legal, and permanent accounts</li>
            <li>Long-term subscriptions and personal correspondence</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Both temp mail and real email serve valuable roles. The key is understanding when to use each. Temp mail is perfect for short-term, anonymous needs. Real email is essential for all other communications where permanence and identity verification are required.
